# CodeSandbox Elixir Starter

This is a minimal Elixir starter app (without Phoenix or any other dependencies).

Note: you can change all occurences of `:starter_app` or `StarterApp` to the title of your app.

Alternatively, you can delete everything except the `.codesandbox` folder and run `mix new . --module MyApp` (replace `MyApp` with the name you want) for a freshly generated project.
