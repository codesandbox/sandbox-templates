# Gleam Starter

Quickly get started with [Gleam](https://gleam.run/) on CodeSandbox.

To get started, open a terminal and run

To enable the Gleam VS Code extension, make sure you have enabled VS Code Web, VS Code Server and Extension Marketplace in Settings > Experiments. You can access this by clicking the CodeSandbox logo in the top left of your screen, and selecting Settings in the dropdown.
