# CodeSandbox Tensorflow Template

This is a starter template for [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). It's a great starting point for any Machine Learning or AI project in CodeSandbox.

## Getting Started

The base image for Tensorflow in CodeSandbox based on the [Jupyter Docker Stacks images](https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks).

Check [the Dockerfile](./.devcontainer/Dockerfile) to see how we configure the container of this sandbox. You can simply edit it yourself and the container will rebuild. Make sure to fork the sandbox first by clicking "Fork" in the top left corner. 


You can also change the Jupyter Lab settings that you can edit in [tasks.json](./.codesandbox/tasks.json). Please note, by default the CodeSandbox notebook will start that you probably want to change for your project.
