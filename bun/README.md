# Bun Starter

Quickly get started with [Bun](https://bun.sh/) using this starter! Bun is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime with a focus on speed.

- This starter starts a Bun HTTP server on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
- You can check [http.ts](./http.ts) to see how the server is started.
- If you want to upgrade Bun, you can change `BUN_VERSION` in the [Dockerfile](./.codesandbox/Dockerfile).
