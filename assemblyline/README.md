# Assemblyline Demo Template

This will run a minimal appliance of [Assemblyline4](https://cybercentrecanada.github.io/assemblyline4_docs/). This template only runs the API server (Flask) and frontend (React) containers along with the required backend databases (Redis, MinIO, Elasticsearch).

In this template, there will be randomly generated data populated for the system to showcase what the system has to offer by providing a more interactive way to discover the system using CodeSandbox.

For more information on how to deploy the full version of Assemblyline (which allows for file submission & analysis), see [Installation - Getting Started](https://cybercentrecanada.github.io/assemblyline4_docs/installation/deployment/).

## Getting Started in CodeSandbox
### Accessing the UI
CodeSandbox should already startup an instance of Assemblyline via the [.tasks](./.codesandbox/tasks.json) and you should see a preview exposed on port 4443. You can click on the "Open Preview in a new window" icon to access Assemblyline's UI within your browser.

### Logging In
You can sign into the local account using `admin` for both the username and password field.

### What's Next?
That's about it from me! You can explore the system to your heart's content ðŸ¤“.

For a walkthrough of the system, you can follow this [guide](https://cybercentrecanada.github.io/assemblyline4_docs/user_manual/user_walkthrough/).
